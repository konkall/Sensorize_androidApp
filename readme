An android app called "Sensorize" that was developed as an assignment for the DIT course "Software development for Networks and Telecommunications".

In this assignment we developed an Android app that assists individuals with vision impairment in their daily navigation. Specifically, this app utilizes the android sensors
(Proximity, Accelerometer) to notify the user, by producing a beeping sound, when they are about to collide with an object, or with another user. The latter is accomplished by 
using a computer application that acts as a server and collects data from all "Sensorize" users. This server is available in the repo "Sensorize_server".
